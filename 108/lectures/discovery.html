<i><b><h3><center>Preliminary Thoughts</center></h3></b></i>

American textbooks often carry the history of Europe up into the Renaissance,
and then plunge into the Age of Discovery and Exploration as a preliminary to
the study of United States history. As a result, we are much more aware of
the effect of the Discovery of the New World, as the Europeans conceived it,
upon the Americas, than the effect that the opening up of new lands had upon
Europe. If we were more aware of the changes that the discoveries caused, we
might be willing to concede that these discoveries were a basic factor in the
end of the Middle Ages.<p>

<center><i><b><h3>Gold and Silver</h3></b></i></center>

<a href="http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/">Columbus' voyage of
1492</a> was intended to discover a shorter all-water route to China and
India than the route around Africa that was being opened up by the
Portuguese, and the aim of both was to be able to by-pass the Muslim and
Byzantine middle-men through which the spices of the East reached Western
Europe. Although Columbus died still believing that he had opened up the
Indies to Spain -- which is why Europeans called the native inhabitants of
the Americas "Indians" -- most realized that a great land mass lay between
them and the spices of the East, and also began to realize that there were
sources of gold and silver there.<p>

The natives had amassed a great deal of golden treasure over the
centuries, and the first flood of "new" gold into Spain and Europe came as
a result of the <i><b>conquistadores</b></i> [Spanish for "conquerors]
seizing this accumulation. With the conquest of Peru by Francisco Pizarro,
new gold began to be mined; and, with the discovery of the silver veins of
San Luis Potosi in Mexico, vast amounts of silver began to appear. The
European explorers began to search primarily for gold, for the "Land of
<i><b>El Dorado</b></i>,"  a fabled land where, after the king bathed each
morning, his subjects would cover his body with gold dust until he shone
like the sun. Since the time of the conquistadores, a series of new
sources of gold strikes have been made -- <i><b>bonanzas</b></i>, from the
Spanish word meaning "prosperity" -- Colorado, California, South Africa,
the Canadian Klondike. Well over 95% of the gold in use today was mined
since 1500.<p>

Gold is like anything else: the more there is of it, the less valuable it
is. And so, as gold and silver arrived in Europe from the Americas, the
price of everything began to rise steadily. Just to explain why that
happened, consider that if a hundred people have one ounce of gold apiece,
they all want to buy wheat, and there are only one hundred bushels of
wheat for sale, the price of a bushel of wheat will be one ounce of gold.
If those same people find a pirate treasure and divide it up so that each
of them has <i>two</i> ounces of gold, but there is still only one hundred
bushels of wheat for sale, the price of a bushel of wheat will be
<i>two</i> ounces of gold. You can look at it another way. When the amount
of gold (or any other medium of exchange) in circulation increases, the
value of salaries, rents, and debts drops. There is a simple equation for
all of this:<p>

<center>Price = the amount of currency divided by the supply of
goods</center><p>

The steady increase of gold and silver in Europe brought about what
historians call <i><b>The Price Revolution</b></i>. People on fixed
incomes were impoverished; it became more advantageous to owe money than
to be solvent. Money lost value every day it stayed in one's pocket, so
the only way to prosper was through trade. Nobles could no longer depend
on their income from the rents paid by their tenants, and began to use
their lands to raise sheep for wool and meat, or to produce other goods
for sale. <b>Land was no longer the basis of wealth, and the land-owners
no longer the dominant economic class</b>.<p>

<center><i><b><h3>Food</h3></b></i></center><p>

We have said that most of the population of medieval Europe went to bed
hungry and that their diet was unbalanced and boring at best. The new
plants that were introduced from the New World changed that situation. A
medieval peasant could expect to harvest about 600 pounds of wheat from an
acre of land. It took a long time for the Europeans to get used to these
new plants, but when that same acre of land was planted in <b>potatoes</b>
-- native to South America -- the peasant could plan on harvesting
<i><b>50,000</b></i> pounds of food. It was even harder for the Europeans
to get adjusted to <b>corn</b> -- eating it made many of them sick, and
they weren't accustomed to planting row crops in their fields -- but they
could harvest 1800 pounds of corn on the acre that had given them only 600
pounds of wheat. Some Europeans, such as the Italians, eventually became
used to corn, but it was used primarily as food for chicken, geese and
other fowl, and for pigs. If the introduction of potatoes produced a
<i>caloric revolution</i>, the acceptance of corn brought about a
<i>protein revolution</i>. Since the land of Europe could now produce more
food, the relative price of food began to drop. The productive capacity of
the land had caught up with the population, and the average European could
now eat more. The Europeans, in turn, introduced corn into Africa and
sweet potatoes in China, where these new foods also changed conditions
dramatically <p>

He could also eat better, since a number of lesser food crops arrived from
the New World that made possible a more varied diet. The French imported
<b>tomatoes</b>, which they called "apples of love," and used them for
ornamental purposes in their flower gardens. They thought that they were
poisonous, which, in fact, many of the early varieties were. In time,
however, the poison-producing capacities of the tomato were bred out, and
the tomato became one of the most popular additions to European cuisine.
There were many other food plants brought back to Europe -- particularly
many varieties of <b>squash</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>pumpkins</b>,
<b>peppers</b> -- that introduced a welcome variety, as well as a wide
range of vitamins, into the European diet. The health of the average
European began to improve, and his height, weight, and strength increased.
As this occurred, his resistance to disease grew.<p>

<center><i><b><h3>Drugs</h3></b></i></center>

A great deal of attention is paid to the terrible death toll among the
native inhabitants of the New World caused by the European's introduction
of new diseases for which they had no immunity. It should also be noted
that over half of the Europeans coming to the Americas died within a year
of their arrival, usually from some fever, and that the death toll among
Europeans in the interior of Africa was so great that it remained largely
unexplored by them until well into the 19th century. The Europeans were
quick to use native remedies for their ailments, and the bark of the
chincona tree -- from which <b>quinine</b> was extracted -- was of great
help to them. The medical establishment of Europe resisted the
introduction of these new drugs, however, and it was not until the 1830's,
for instance, that quinine was brought into general use. This lag has
continued to be the case. It was only in 1952, for instance, that Western
medical researchers recognized the value of Rauwolfia, a root that the
inhabitants of India had chewed to relieve nervousness for centuries. The
active substance was extracted from the root and sold as <b>miltown</b>,
the first tranquilizer. Given this general resistance to "native
remedies," the medicines and medical techniques of the new lands had
relatively little effect on Europe. The importance of the drugs of the new
worlds lay in another direction.<p>

We have noted that medieval Europeans displayed violent swings of
emotions. Part of this may have been simply a difference in cultural
norms, but it should be noted that the men and women of medieval Europe
had relatively little personal control over their states of mind. Like
most other parts of the world, the Europeans had an effective depressant
in alcohol, but, unlike any other of the world's civilization, they did
not have an <b>alkaloid stimulant</b>. These were quickly important from
their native lands, and their use swiftly spread. The first was
<b>cocoa</b> from the Aztecs, a rich source of caffeine, and Europeans
began their long love affair with chocolate. Coming next were
<b>coffee</b>, another source of caffeine, from the Near East, and
<b>tobacco</b>, adding nicotine to the Europeans' personal stash of drugs.
Finally <b>tea</b> from the Far East introduced another potent source of
caffeine. The Europeans developed the custom of mixing caffeine with
<b>sugar</b>, an import from India and the Near East, a practice that cut
the bitterness of the drink and enhanced its effectiveness.<p>

At the same time, <b>coca leaves</b> from South America yielded cocaine,
<b>opium</b> from Far Eastern poppies provided both opium itself and
morphine, and <b>hashish</b> from the Near East offered a potent form of
marijuana. The use of these narcotics and depressants was widespread until
well into the 19th century. It's said that Coca-Cola started out as a
medicinal concoction laced with cocaine, and was guaranteed to slow you
down, but, when such patent medicines became illegal, the company
substituted caffeine for cocaine and guaranteed that their drink would pep
you up.<p>

In any event, the exploitation of lands beyond the sea gave Europeans a
variety of potent stimulants and depressants, and they now had some
control over their moods. Western culture has continued this practice, and
few of us go through a day without a smoke, a coke, a cup of coffee, or a
candy bar. It is difficult to imagine what people might be like if they
did not have easy access to these New World drugs.<p>

<center><i><b><h3>Industrial
Materials</h3></b></i></center>

Less dramatic than the influx of gold and silver, but perhaps more
important in the long run were the raw materials extracted from the new
lands. The most important single industry in medieval Europe was the
manufacture of cloth, and the manufacturers were always looking for
colorful <b>dyes</b> that would not fade or wash out. They found them in
the New World. <b>Brazil</b> is named after a tree in the Near East, the
bark of which produced a good red dye; and the islands off the Carolina
coast in North America were found to be a good source of a rich and
relatively permanent blue dye called <b>indigo</b>. Europe was almost
deforested, and was quick to import American <b>wood</b>. Most North
American colonists</a> were expected to unload their belongings from their
ship and then fill it with shingles for its return voyage. Tall oaks and
pines allowed the Europeans to build larger ships, and they were quick to
extract barrels of <b>pitch</b> and <b>turpentine</b> from the pines and
spruces of the New World. American <b>furs</b> were popular for both
clothing and the making of felt. All of the colonial powers anxiously
sought for deposits of <b>salt</b>, and most were able to find them.<p>

This list could be extended greatly, but the point should be obvious.
European manufacture had been woefully short of industrial materials. The
resources of the New World gave it the supplies it needed to produce the
surplus necessary to begin a profitable trade with the other parts of the
world, parts that Europe had not be able to conquer as it had the
Americas.<p>

<center><i><b><h3>Knowledge</h3></b></i></center>

We have discussed how medieval philosophers and "proto-scientists" based
their search for knowledge upon logic, and how the basis of that logic lay
in the manipulation of <i>categories</i>. The discoverers and explorers
began to bring back reports and specimens of phenomena and things that did
not fit easily into the categories with which the European intellectuals
were accustomed. It was easy enough to say "Socrates is a man," but where
<IMG SRC="../graphics/platypus.gif"  WIDTH="#200" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"
ALIGN="right" ALT="[a duck-billed platypus]">does one put the gorilla? Is
he also a man? What about the duck-billed platypus? It has a bill,
feathers, and webbed feet, so it's a bird, right? But it has scales and
swims around underwater, so it's a fish? Or is it a mammal, since it has
hair and gives birth to living young? These things were not easy to
answer, and it took time to sort them out. Until that was done, however,
the logic based upon categories was almost useless. European intellectuals
turned from the practice of logical investigation to observing and
recording, measuring, and arranging. The patterns that had dominated
European thought since <b>Peter Abelard</b> fell into disuse, and the
logic of categories did not emerge again until the mid-19th century with
the publication of Darwin's <i><b>The Origin of Species</b></i><p>

<center><i><b><h3>A Conclusion</h3></b></i></center>

It's easy to look back upon the men and women of medieval times with a
feeling of moral and intellectual superiority. Certainly they were capable
of great cruelty and seemed curiously passive in the face of a social
organization in which a wealthy and powerful few proclaimed that everyone
else was innately inferior. You might ask why the "people" did not demand
liberty and equality, why they did not establish education for all, why
they kept women in a generally subordinate role, and why a whole lot of
other things. They were different in many ways from us, and, by our
standards, they were inferior, but it is important to ask the reasons for
those differences.<p>

One difference is exemplified by the "Birkenhead Rule."  When the the
British liner <i>Birkenhead</i> was sinking and everyone was trying to get
into the lifeboats, someone shouted out <i>Women and children first!</i>,
and this has been the custom of the sea ever since. A medieval man or
woman would never have thought of raising such a cry. A child is a burden
upon society, consuming more than it produces for at least the first ten
or twelve years of its life. Able-bodied men, however, are an investment
that society has already made and from whom it must gain a return. Young
women are necessary to restore the losses of population due to wars,
famines, plagues, and the other dangers of life, but they do not produce
as much as mature men and so are less valuable to society -- unless of
course, they fall into short supply. In the middle ages, young men and
women would have had first call on the lifeboats, and the young and aged
would have been left behind. This may strike you as cruel and inhumane,
but that is only because you are rich enough to afford such luxuries as
believing that the Birkenhead Rule is the only proper way to behave.<p>

The gulf that lies between you and the men and women of medieval Europe is
mostly the difference between your wealth and their poverty. Many of you
drive an auto with a hundred horse-power engine. The work of a single man
is rated at about 1/8 horse-power, so you have the equivalent of 800
slaves to carry you from place to place. Your rooms are lighted by the
equivalent of hundreds of candles, and your closet has more clothes than
the entire population of a medieval village possessed. The knives in your
kitchen are made of a steel so fine that, in medieval times, only a king
could have afforded their equal. You look back upon the men and women of
medieval Europe and see their ignorance, dirt, and heartlessness; if they
could look at you, they would see only a person wealthy beyond their
comprehension. They would also wonder why you should enjoy such riches
since they worked much harder and longer than you and had so much less to
show for it. And if you could speak to them and tell them how you felt
that people should behave, they would think to themselves <i>Sure, it's
easy to make sacrifices and be generous and kind when you are wealthy. I
wonder what would happen to their high principles if they were hungry and
cold most of their lives?</i><p>

I suppose that the basic question is why you <i>are</i> so much wealthier
than they. The usual answer is that you are enjoying the fruits of global
commerce and the Industrial Revolution. But neither of those things would
have occurred without the discovery and exploitation of the New World.
That's one reason to consider that 1492 is as good a date as any and
better than most to mark the end of the middle ages. It also marked the
beginning of a 500-year boom economy for Europeans and their descendants,
but that's another matter.<p>
