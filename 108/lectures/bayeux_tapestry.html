It is not an easy matter to provide an outline of an essentially pictorial
lecture, so I'll simply offer you some background and suggest some sites
that provide an opportunity of viewing the tapesty itself. Osprey Books
has put on- line an extraordinarily fine site, the<B> 
<A HREF="http://www.essentialnormanconquest.com/osehnctapestry.html"> 
Bayeux Tapestry</A></B>
[www.essentialnormanconquest.com/osehnctapestry.html].  You will need a
shockwave plug-in to view these pages, but you can download this plug-in
free of charge from
<A HREF="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/">
[www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/]</A>. The Osprey site allows you
to view the tapestry as a continuous roll, the way you would viewed it if
you were to visit the Museum where it is now displayed. By contrast, The
<A HREF="http://www.hastings1066.com/baythumb.shtml">Hastings 1066</A>
site [www.hastings1066.com/baythumb.shtml] provides several thumb-nail
images as an index of the tapestry so that you can quickly access
whichever panel you want to examine more closely.<P>

The Bayeux Tapestry is one of the most important pictorial works surviving
from the middle ages, and certainly the most important from the eleventh
century. It is not really a tapestry, but an embroidery of colored wool on
an unbleached linen background. It comprises a series of connected panels
two hundred and three feet in length, with each of the panels about
eighteen inches high. Much of what we know about its origins is a matter
of guesswork. It was almost certainly the work of English embroiderers,
and was most probably produced in the famous embroidery works of
Winchester. The best guess is that it was commissioned by Odo, bishop of
Bayeux, William the Conqueror's half-brother, and one of the leading
figures in the invasion of England. It was perhaps completed on 1077 in
time for the consecration of the new cathedral at Bayeux. Or perhaps it
was finished in 1083. Historians can argue endlessly about such things.
Some have suggested that it was hung around the nave of Bayeux cathedral
on feast days, but it doesn't seem to have made for that specific purpose
since it is not long enough to reach completely around the nave.<p>

During the French Revolution, it was hauled out to cover a wagon-load of
ammunition being sent to the northern front where the Republican French
were being attacked by Monarchist enemies. A young lawyer of Bayeux pulled
the tapestry from the wagon and replaced it with a oiled and waterproof
cloth much better suited for the purpose. He carried the tapestry home,
and hid it in his attic, where it remained for the next thirty years. When
it as brought out, it was turned over to the bishop of Bayeux, who placed
it in the bishop's palace. It has remained there, except for a short time
when the Nazis took it to Paris for scientific examination. The bishop's
palace is now a museum in which the tapestry is on permanent display and
viewed by thousands of visitors a year. Americans form a large portion of
the crowds, since the beaches on which US troops landed on 6 June 1944 to
begin the Allied invasion of Europe lie only a couple of miles north of
Bayeux and there is a 
<IMG SRC="../graphics/d-day.jpg" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10" ALIGN="left">
large cemetery of American war dead</A> not too far away. If you get to
Bayeux in late September, you'll be in time for the Calvados season.
Calvados is Norman cider. Go at it easy; it'll tear your throat out and
leave you with a headache that you'll never forget, if you somehow manage
to live through it.<p>

The first half of the Tapestry depict the adventures of Harold Godwinson,
who was wrecked in Ponthieu in 1064 and was ransomed from the count of
Ponthieu by William, duke of Normandy (1046-1087). Its portrayal of these
events is entirely from the Norman point of view and serves as a
justification of William's invasion and conquest of England in the Autumn
of 1066. Harold is portrayed as a usurper who foreswore his sacred oath to
support William as the successor to Edward the Confessor, king of
England.<P>

The second half shows William's preparations for the invasion of England,
the decisive battle of Hastings -- in which Harold was killed -- and ends
with the retreat of the defeated English. The last part, perhaps some
twenty-five feet, of the Tapestry is incomplete, and its account may have
continued to the point at which William was crowed king at Westminster
Abbey, near London. Since this was apparently the place pictured in the
first panel, such a conclusion would had a significant symmetry. The
entire work would then have commenced with old King Edward seated in state
at Westminister and would have concluded with the new King William seated
in state at the same place. This is entirely guesswork, however. One of
the advantages of missing or incomplete documents is that they offer some
scope for the exercise of one's imagination.<p>

One cannot use the Tapestry as a source for political history, since it is
biased, and also because it is a very complex "document." The upper and
lower borders are mostly simply decoration, but sometimes show scenes that
may be comments upon or clarifications of the story unfolding in the
middle section. Some of these scenes can be identified as being from the
Bible or Aesop's Fables, but the sources of others are unknown and the
significance of the scenes obscure at best. One might use as an example,
the panel that portrays 
<A HREF="http://www.hastings1066.com/bayeux2.shtml">
Harold and his men</A> eating and drinking in an upper room while waiting
for a fair wind to the Continent. The Norman account of these events
claims that King Edward had told Harold to go to Norman and announce to
Duke William that the childless Edward wish William to succeed him as king
of England. Harold, however was not only the greatest noble on England but
was also ambitious. It was not difficult for his followers to convince him
not to reveal King Edward's will to Duke William, to bide his time, and -
as soon as Edward was dead - to seize the royal treasury at Winchester and
have himself crowned king.<P>

There is nothing in the human figures or in the text to suggest that this
was what was going on, but a small picture in the lower border clearly
suggests that this was the case. The picture is that of an ungainly bird
sitting in a tree under which an animal (a leopard judging by its spots)
is lying. They are looking at each other with their mouths open, and there
is some object in the air between them. It doesn't take a genius to
recognize the scene.<P>

<H2>  The Fox and the Crow</H2>

A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and
settle on a branch of a tree.  "That's for me, as I am a Fox," said Master
Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree.  "Good-day, Mistress
Crow," he cried.  "How well you are looking to-day: how glossy your
feathers; how bright your eye.  I feel sure your voice must surpass that
of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from
you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds."  The Crow lifted up her
head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the
piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by Master Fox.
"That will do," said he. "That was all I wanted. In exchange for your
cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future.<P>

"Do not trust flatterers."
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Although the tapestry portrays a leopard in place of a fox, the moral is
the same and the reason for pointing to this particular fable at this
particular place is quite clear. Harold's vanity would lead him to try to
be what he was not and, as a consequence, to lose everything he held
dear.<P>

The Tapestry is most revealing in its details. One can see <A
HREF="http://www.hastings1066.com/bayeux24.shtml">how a castle was
built</A> and discover that they were originally wooden stockades
constructed on artificial mounds, trace the process of

from the felling of the trees to the launching of the vessels, view 
<A HREF="http://www.hastings1066.com/bayeux1.shtml">Edward, king of
England</A>, sitting in state at Westminster long before there was a
Parliament sitting there, watch the death of a king and the <A

usurper</A>, see a <A HREF="http://www.hastings1066.com/bayeux22.shtml"> a
bunch of soldiers pillaging the countryside</A>, and many other things.
Even better, many of the places pictured in the tapestry still exist and
can be compared with their depiction in the Tapestry. A comparison of the

depiction</A> of the famous monastery of Mt.-St.-Michel with

" HSPACE="10" VSPACE=#10" ALIGN="right">
a modern photograph</A> of the same place can be a great help in
understanding how the designer of the tapestry pictured the world about
him (or her). It would be well worth your time to study the scenes
portrayed in the Bayeux Tapestry carefully. They offer a rare glimpse into
the lives of both high and low in northwestern Europe in the middle of the
eleventh century.<P>

There is a great deal of material on the web about the tapestry and the events it
portrays. Perhaps the best coverage is provided by the Introduction to the
