CHORUS SPEAKS:

<I>The time is early Autumn. Dappled rays of sunlight play about the
forest floor, and soft breezes send leaves twirling down upon the Owl 
and
the Cat from time to time. What better time and what better place to
discuss Medieval History?<p>

So then to that forest glade let us now hie,<br>
to hear of the Investiture Controversie</I><HR>

The Pussycat Speaks.<P>

<i>Medieval History textbooks always devote a lot of space to the
Investiture Controversy, and have more emperors and popes running
around getting excited about rings, sticks, clumps of dirt, and
such stuff that it's hard to figure out what was going on. Just
what is "Investiture" and what makes it important enough that I
should worry about it?</i><p>

An "investiture ceremony" is when someone gets inducted into a new
office organization and is given some <b>thing</b> as a sign that
he or she now holds that office or belongs to that organization.
The Chancellor has a chain put around his neck (<i>No Chancellor
jokes, please. He's new so give him a chance.</i>), fraternities
and sororities give pins, administrators get nameplates for their
desks, soldiers get chevrons or some other insignia, and so forth.
Nowadays, the ceremony is only symbolic, but in the Middle Ages a
person was not really inducted or whatever until he or she
received the insignia of office.<p>

The Investiture Controversy was about the ceremony by which a man
became a bishop or an archbishop. During the investiture, the
bishop or archbishop- elect was given a signet ring representing
his authority to act legally for his territory (<i>diocese</i> or
<i>archdiocese</i>), a long staff like a shepherd's crook
(<i>crozier</i>) signifying his spiritual leadership of the people
of the diocese, a lump of dirt (<i>glebe</i>) that demonstrated
his possession and ownership of the lands with which the churches
in his diocese had been endowed, and a white woolen stole to hang
around his neck (<i>pallium</i>) indicating that he was a
legitimate successor to a long tradition of spiritual teaching and
leadership reaching all the way back to the apostles (<i>apostolic
succession</i>). <p>

Since bishops and archbishops appointed and directed all the
clerics below them, either directly or indirectly, the investiture
ceremony was the most important single factor in selecting church
personnel and setting the structure of authority within the Church
as a whole.<p>

<i>Okay, so the ceremony was important, but what was the
"Controversy" all about?</i><p>

Well, laymen took part in the investiture ceremony...<p>

<i>Why? I thought that you said that it was a ceremony investing
<b>churchmen</b> with their office?</i><p>

I did, but remember that churchmen took part in the investiture of
laymen. Remember that it was a pope who put the crown on
Charlemagne's head.<p>

<i>Oh, yeah.</i><p>

As I was saying, laymen took part in the investiture ceremony,
claiming the right to invest the candidate with some or all of the
insignia of his office.<p>

<i>What did they base their claim on?</i><p>

One argument was that by giving the bishop-elect his ring of legal
authority the layman was promising to back up the bishops
authority by force if necessary, by giving the glebe he was
promising to defend the Church's possessions, and by giving the
crozier he was recognizing that the bishop had powers over his --
the layman's -- subjects. <p>

<i>What about the pallium?</i><p>

There was a lot of dispute about the pallium, which had to be sent
by the pope, but a layman could claim that by investing with the
pallium, he was recognizing the bishop's rights over him and his
heirs. After all, when he died, the bishop would have an important
role in investing his successor.<p>

<i>That sounds reasonable. Why was there an argument about
it?</i><p>

Think about it for a moment. If the layman had the right to invest
a bishop- elect, he also could refuse to invest someone. It gave
laymen a veto power over the selection of church officials. After
all the lay argument simply boiled down to the view that
investiture consisted of a series of acts in which the layman
transferred power from himself to a churchman. The Church argued
that its authority came directly from God and not from a bunch of
secular lords. The Bible had Jesus saying "You are Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my Church...."  That's a pun, by the way.
<i>petros</i> or Peter means "rock" in Greek. <p>

<i>I didn't know that Jesus spoke in Greek.</i><p>

He didn't, but that's another matter. The point is that the Church
argued that it, the Church, was established by Jesus and given to
the disciple Peter and his successors. Of course, Peter was the
first bishop of Rome, so the popes are his successors. That
argument, by the way, is called the <i>Petrine Doctrine</i><p>

<i>If then churchmen felt that way, why did they let laymen take
part in the investiture ceremony in the first place?</i><p>

They really didn't have much choice. When the central government
of the Carolingian empire lost power, there was no one to protect
the Church, and local strong men, hungry for land to support more
fighting men to protect their territories against civil war, and
raiders like the Vikings, Magyars, and Saracens, took control of
church lands by appointing local church officials.<p>

<i>Didn't any of the churchmen resist?</i><p>

Yes, but they had to hire mercenary troops to do their fighting,
and leader of such troops usually ended up dominating the bishop
and his lands. It wasn't all bad, though. Many laymen built
monasteries and churches and endowed them with lands from their
own estates. I suppose that it was only natural that such men
would continue to regard these establishments as family property.
Anyway, by the early 900's almost all of the diocese and
archdiocese, and monasteries and convents, were under the
"protection," or control, of some lay lord or another.<p>

<i>I'll bet that the pope was ticked off at that.</i><p>

Not really. They didn't know or care much what was going on. You
see, Pepin, the first Carolingian king, had given the Church most
of central Italy. The popes weren't able to control the <i>Papal
States</i> any better than the Carolingians had been able to
control their empire. By 900, the Papal States were controlled by
local lords, and the office of the papacy itself was under the
control of political factions in the city of Rome. The popes were
powerless to do anything about the <i>feudalization</i> of the
Church.<p>

<i>Okay, so the whole Church was controlled by laymen, and all of
the important Church offices were filled by secular appointees.
How did the Church get to the point where it was able to challenge
the Holy Roman Empire about this sort of thing?</i><p>

A good question. Not all laymen were happy with the situation.
They felt that European society lacked moral guidance, and they
were probably right. You probably remember that Gerald the Good
was trying to turn his lands into some sort of independent
monastic state when he died in 909?<p>

<i>Vaguely</i>.<p>

Well, check your notes. If you'll remember Duke William of
Aquitaine was a neighbor and admirer of Gerald. In 910, William
acquired some lands in Burgundy -- including a dog kennel way back
in the boondocks -- that he couldn't defend, so he implemented
Gerald's plan. He established the monastery, calling it
<i>Cluny</i>, which means "dog kennel", endowed it with all of the
lands he had in the area, and gave it a <i>charter</i> -- a legal
document like a deed -- that made it independent of all local
officials, both lay and clergy, and obedient and answerable only
to the pope.<p>

<i>But I thought that the popes at the time were powerless.</i><p>

That's just the point. Cluny was an ecclesiastical establishment
but was practically an independent state. <p>

<i>Why didn't the local lords take it over?</i><p>

A lot of the sons of local lords joined Cluny, and the Burgundian
nobility became proud of the place and started giving it more
lands. The monks in Cluny set up a very austere, regular, and
religious pattern of living that impressed the nobles so much that
they wanted to support it.<p>

<i>Why?</i><p>

The monks said prayers nine times a day, and the people of the
time considered those prayers something like payments to God in
compensation for the sins of the world. The more society could
pile up, the better off everyone -- even the dead ones -- would
be. Barbara Rosenwein is an expert of Cluny, and her books
<i>Rhinoceros bound</i> and <i>To be a Neighbor of Cluny</i> would
give you a good idea of what was happening. It was a complex
business.<p>

Anyway, Cluny became very influential. Local landowners all over
the south of France endowed Cluny with their private churches,
asked Cluny to take over the monasteries they controlled and
reform them into establishments like Cluny, and supported
candidates for Church offices nominated by <i>Cluniac</i> leaders.
Cluny went on the sponsor all sorts of reform movements, <i>The
Peace of God</i> and <i>The Truce of God</i> that attempted to
limit feudal warfare, the <i>crusades</i>, which got started first
as French volunteers went to help the Christian states of Spain
drive back their Muslim neighbors, and, of course, removing church
offices from lay control. Another thing it did was to encourage
monasteries and cathedrals to become centers of learning.<p>

In the late 900's, a young man by the name of <i>Gerbert of
Aurillac</i><p>

<i>Is that the same Aurillac as the one that Apollinaris Sidonius
and Gerald the Good had so much to do with?</i><p>

Yes, Why?<p>

<i>Nothing, just wondering.</i><p>

Well, Gerbert went to study at the cathedral school of Vic and the
monastery of Ripoll in Catalonia, a region of Spain that bordered
the lands of the <i>Caliphate of Cordoba</i><p>

<i>The what of what?</i><p>

<i>The Caliphate of Cordoba</i>. The richest lands of Spain were
held by the Muslims, and they were ruled by a Caliph who had his
capital at Cordoba in the South of the country. Cordoba was the
richest city in western Europe, trading in African gold, slaves
brought from overland through France, and the products and
manufactures of Spain itself. When the largest library in the
Christian West was the four hundred volumes of the monastery of
Corbie in northern France, the libraries of Corboba had some
400,000 books. They said at the time<p>

<i>Excuse me, but you're beginning to digress</i><p>

Oh, yes. I am, aren't I? What was I talking about?<p>

<i>Gerbils of Aurillac.</i><p>

That's <B>GERBERT</B>. Well, Gerbert studied in these Catalan
schools and learned a great deal, including some Muslim "science".
The Muslims were much further advanced than the Christians,
particularly in mathematics and astronomy, and<p>

<i>Are you digressing again?</i><p>

No, it only seems that way.  Anyway, when Gerbert returned to
France, he became a renowned scholar. In fact, a medieval
historian <i>William of Malmesbury</i>, believed that he was a
magician and had made a pact with Satan. Read William's <i>History
of the Kings of England</i>, if you like fabulous stories.<p>

Otto II, the Holy Roman Emperor, was so impressed by Gerbert's
reputation, that he hired him as tutor for the Crown Prince.
Gerbert taught Otto Jr. a lot, and Otto Jr. got the idea of
freeing the papacy and making the Holy Roman Empire a real
successor to the Roman Empire in the West. When he took the throne
as Otto III in 983, Junior kept Gerbert on as his chief Counsellor
and together they planned the conquest of the North of Italy --
which was supposed to belong to the emperor --and cleaning up the
mess in Rome. The Germans crossed the Alps in the year 1000,
captured Rome, and Otto made Gerbert pope. Gerbert took the name
of Silvester II. Silvester I had been the bishop of Rome when
Constantine issued <i>the Edict of Milan</i> ... do you remember
about the Edict of Milan?<p>

<i>No.</i><p>

That's good. ...and so Gerbert's choice of name symbolized the
liberation of the Church from long oppression.<p>

<i>Who invested him?</i><p>

Well, local church officials at the direction to Emperor Otto.<p>

<i>It doesn't seem as if Gerbert helped get rid of Lay Investiture
very effectively what with the emperor directing all the
action.</i><p>

One of the things you learn from history is that things don't
happen all at once. Rome didn't decline and fall in a day as we
medieval historians say. Take my word for it, this was an
important event leading to the investiture struggle.<p>

<i>Okay. I'll take your word for it.</i><p>

Now the Church's attention was fixed on the German emperor. When
<i>Henry the Fowler</i>... Do you remember Henry the Fowler?<p>

<i>No.</i><p>

That's fine. Keep up the good work. When he took over leadership
of the German dukes in 919, he asked only that he have control of
the Church throughout their lands....<p>

<i>Why in the world did they give it to him?</i><p>

If you had a horde of murdering Magyars at your door, you might be
willing to give up something, too. In any event, many of the
districts of Germany were actually under the political control of
the local bishops. Some of the most important of them were the
<i>prince-bishops</i> of Mainz, Bingen, and Liege. Their lands
were wealthy, and the emperors needed their assistance in
defending the empire. It was only natural that the emperors should
want to make certain that the prince-bishops would be loyal to
them, so -- during the time that the pope was without power --
they took the lead in choosing the bishops, investing them, and
protecting their positions.<p>

<i>So Gerbert hadn't done anything to change that
situation.</i><p>

No, but that was because the popes still depended on the emperors
to protect them from the local lords of the papal states. In fact,
the emperors more or less dictated who would be pope. That was
changed by two remarkable imperial appointees. <i>Pope Leo IX</i>
held office from 1049 to 1054 and travelled about Europe, holding
councils and organizing local reform. He also established the
<i>College of Cardinals</i>, a permanent group of papal advisors
and officials, and appointed a number of reformers to the College.
Up to this time, the leaders of the movement for church reform had
been among the Cluniacs; now the popes had taken over direction of
reform movement and had gained a lot of moral support. <p>

<i>Emperor Henry III</i> died in 1056. His son and heir was
underage. Medieval governments generally did not operate too well
under such conditions because officials never knew what the new
ruler would do when he came of age. So the imperial officials
decided to go along with another reformer as pope since they
didn't want the other reformers in the Church making problems for
them. The new pope was <i>Nicholas II</i> (1059-1061), and he made
two important moves. First, he passed a decree that, from then on,
popes would be selected by the College of Cardinals, and, second,
he made an alliance with the <i>Norman Kingdom of Sicily</i>. Now
the papacy had some protection from the German emperors.<p>

<i>What about the German kid? How did he take all this when he
came of age?</i><p>

Well, that was when the Controversy part of the Investiture
Controversy began.<p>

Henry IV found that his secular princes had taken away a lot of
imperial power and wealth while he had been growing up, and he
needed the support of the prince-bishops. But there was a
churchman, a monk by the name of <i>Hildebrand</i>, who was
determined that Henry wasn't going to get any more control over
the German bishops. Hildebrand was a leading reformer and the
chief papal counselor, and became pope himself in 1073 with the
name of <i>Gregory VII</i> (1073-1085). Both Henry and Gregory
were very determined men, and were soon at each other hammer and
tongs, as we used to say.<p>

<i>Hammer and tongs? You <b>really</b> used to say that?</i><p>

Yes, but that's beside the point. Gregory VII claimed not only
that the pope was independent of all earthly monarchs, but was
superior to them in that their authority came from God and the
pope was God's voice on Earth. Henry IV and his successors claimed
that the lands and secular authority of the German bishops came
from the emperor.<p>

Henry and his son, Henry V, tried to keep control of the German
bishops, even to the point of using force, while Gregory VII
stirred up the local German lords against the emperors. In 1122,
when it became clear that both the Church and the Empire were on
the point of wrecking each other, they reached a compromise with
the <i>Concordat of Worms</i>.<p>

<i><b>Concordat of Worms?</b> You're making that up, aren't
you?</i><p>

Don't be funny. Worms is a city in Germany pronounced "voorms",
and a concordat is a formal, written agreement of compromise. The
Concordat of Worms was the formal agreement that representatives
of the Church and the Empire signed at the city of Worms.<p>

<i>I thought you were building up to a joke. So what was the
outcome?</i><p>

The emperors gave up the right of investing the bishops with the
crozier and ring.<p>

<i>So the Church won?</i><p>

I'm not sure. The emperors kept the right of being present at the
ceremony. If I were a bishop-elect, I think that I would want to
make sure that the emperor approved of me, especially with him
sitting there and his army standing outside.<p>

<i>So nobody won?</i><p>

Not really. That's what a compromise means. <p>

<i>So what was the point in my learning all of this?</i><p>

Well, the Investiture Controversy had some far-reaching effects.
The Church was now under the control of a professional elite and
had established the principle that non-professionals shouldn't
have any say in how the Church ran its affairs. When the
Protestants rebelled against the Catholic Church four hundred
years later, one of the things that they demanded was that lay
people should have a big role in running the Church. Then, too,
the Church had gained its ends through politics and had to
continue playing politics.<p>

In Germany, the authority of the emperors had been damaged to the
point that the region didn't develop a national government until
1870 with a war against France. The First and Second World Wars --
which took about 100,000,000 lives -- were continuations of that
first conflict. I suppose that you could say that there wouldn't
have been any Adolf Hitler If there hadn't been an Investiture
Controversy.<p>

<i>Isn't that stretching things a little?</i><p>

Maybe.<p>
