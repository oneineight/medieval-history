<i>7:00 a.m., Sunday 10 April 13th: the high point of the middle ages.
Jubilee Year in Rome, with all of Europe paying its respects to the Church,
which had at last appeared to have triumphed over its opponents, freed itself
from secular control and emerged as the moral arbiter of European
affairs.</I><p>

Despite this apparent unity, two political philosophies were contending for
dominance. The Church preserved the Roman ideal of a centralized and
disciplined state encompassing all of Christendom, while the secular
governments had abandoned this ideal. Unlike China, Mesopotamia, and other
parts of the Old World that had sustained empires throughout their history,
western Europe did not have a central plain or river system upon which such
an empire could be based. Instead, there were many states, each following its
own path of development: England: constitutional monarchy; Aragon: social
contract; Florence: political machine; Milan, military dictatorship; Rome,
theocracy; France: absolute monarchy; Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden
(Switzerland): pure democracy; London: syndicalism; Venice: oligarchy;
Poland: parliamentary government; and so forth. Probably at no time in
history or anywhere on Earth had so many different approaches to statecraft
existed in such close proximity.<p>

The greatest of these states was the Church.</i><p>

</ul>
<li>5. THE 14TH CENTURY AND THE END OF THE ILLUSION
</ul>
</ul>
<i>Europe had pursued the ideal of a society that would achieve unity without
imposing uniformity, and, in 1300, it appeared to contemporaries as if it had
achieved that goal. In less than a decade, that belief would be shattered by
the first of a series of catastrophes.
