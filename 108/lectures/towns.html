<p>The year 1000 was a turning point in the fortunes of western Europe.
Within a decade of that date, Olaf had converted most of the Scandinavians
to Christianity, and the Viking threat came to an end. King Stephen
accepted Christianity for himself and the Hungarian people, and the
Magyars joined Christendom. The Muslim Caliphate of Cordoba collapsed into
civil war, and the armed merchant vessels of the Italian city-states
wrested control of the western Mediterranean from the Muslim fleets of
north Africa. The Muslims who controlled the mountain passes between
France and Italy made the mistake of capturing Majolus, abbot of Cluny,
and holding him for ransom. After obtaining his freedom, the Burgundian
warrior class drove the Muslims from their fortresses and restored secure
land communication between France and Italy.

<p>Otto I, the German emperor, entered Rome and freed the papacy from the
control of local Roman political factions. He turned the papacy over to
Gerbert of Aurillac, a learned and reform-minded monk and teacher, and the
Cluniac reform movement finally reached the highest levels of the western
Church. Meanwhile, the Guiscards and Hautevilles, a family of adventurers
from Normandy, began the reconquest of southern Italy and the
establishment of the Norman Kingdom of Naples and Sicily.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>Western Europe's economic fortunes began to
change just as quickly. The rulers of Kiev had destroyed the Khazar state
to the east of them and, by so doing, removed a buffer that had protected
the Varangian Route of Russian rivers from the peoples of central Asia.
One of these peoples, the Patchinaks (there are various spellings of this
name), settled around 1000 in those lands where the Varangian rivers
entered the Black Sea.  The Varangian route was blocked, and merchants
began once again to carry goods from the Baltic to Mediterranean markets
by way of the Seine-Loire-Garonne/Rhone river routes of France. In turn,
Eastern merchants in appreciable numbers began to appear once again in the
West. Two other events, less appreciated than those we have mentioned,
also altered the economic situation of western Europe. Shortly after 1000,
the old slave routes linking Poland with western Europe were reopened, but
the traders were now driving cattle and horses west to trade for
manufactured goods. This trade would prove to be an important factor in
Poland's conversion to the western, Roman Catholic form of Christianity.
Finally, with the use of new engineering techniques, a bridge was
constructed that opened the Brenner pass for relatively easy transport and
facilitated communications between the Germanies and Italy.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>The old trade routes of western Europe were
reopened just as those of Russian were closed, and Baltic-Byzantine trade
was returned to the West after a long absence. The passage of this
long-distance trade began to stimulate the western economy.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>Conditions in the West were favorable to a
revival of commerce. The slow spread of advanced farming techniques was a
fundamental factor in this development. The heavy plow made it possible to
open up the fertile but heavy bottom lands of Europe, and to plow lands
with a single pass rather than the criss-cross pattern the lands demanded
of the scratch plough. The heavy plow required greater tractive power, and
the development of metal horse-shoes, padded horse-collars, and tandem
harnessing made it possible to use horses as draft animals. Horses were
not only faster (plowing 30+ % more in a day than oxen) but were more
intelligent than oxen and so did not need the attention of a man wielding
a goad to direct them. The peasants discovered the value of leguminous
crops (peas and beans) in restoring soil fertility, and -- although they
did not realize it -- improved the human and animal diet of western Europe
with the addition of the relatively high grade of protein provided by peas
and beans. The deep plow and the use of legumes made it possible to change
the two-field system, in which 50% of the arable land was put in fallow
each season, to a three-field-system, in which only 33% of the land needed
to be in fallow in order to restore its fertility and to kill off the
growth of weeds.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>Agricultural productivity, as well as
production, increased. An increased supply of food led to an increase in
the peasant population at the same time that fewer hands were needed to
provide the populations food requirements. A "surplus" peasant population
arose that needed an outlet. Many of these peasants emigrated to the
frontiers of Europe and began to support western European expansion by
populating the lands the warrior class conquered.  Many others turned to
developing Europe's "internal frontier" by draining marshes, as in Belgium
and the Netherlands, irrigating dry lands, as in Spain and parts of
southern France, and clearing forests, as in Wales and eastern Germany.
They began to transform Europe's landscape.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>Even this was not sufficient to absorb all
of the "surplus" peasant population, and many of them turned to trade and
manufacture. Most village communities included part-time artisans, who
gained an additional income by working during the winter to supply the
village's need for particular goods and services. As the size and number
of villages grew, some peasant artisans began to work at full-time at
their trades This same increase in population led to the need for more
distinctive personal names, and many people took their trade as a second
name. Consequently, modern family names are a living record of the
elaboration of the western European economy. Fletcher, Frenier, Shields,
Schild, Spearman, Bowman, Boyer, Greaves, Sadler and others were engaged
in the production of armaments, while Houseman, Mason, Maurer, Thatcher,
Glazer, Turner, Carpenter, Sawyer, Sierra, and Dauber were in the business
of home construction and improvement. Smith, Schmidt, LeFevre, Faber,
Tinker, Plumb, Herrera and Ferrier worked in metals. Busch, Bush, Brewer,
Brewster, Aylward, Boardman were in the brewing and bar-tending business.
Arkwright, Cooper, Hooper, Boatwright, Wheelwright, Cartwright, Wainwright
built boxes and barrels, boats, carts, and wagons. Wagner, Chapman,
Packer, Merchant, Marchant, Drover, Dealer, Coiner, Minter were all
engaged in the trading and selling of the products of such artisans. The
list can be extended immensely. When long-distance trade began to flow
once again through western Europe, there already existed a significant,
although scattered, body of manufacturers and craftsmen in western Europe.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>These two currents converged in the
"revival" of urban life. The western European cities of the Roman empire
had been, for the most part, artificial creations established by the
imperial government to centralize legal, religious and economic
activities. As the empire in the West declined, power and population began
to move from the cities to the countryside. By the tenth century, many of
these Roman cities had been abandoned, or had been reduced to fortresses,
cathedrals, or monasteries with a nearby village, often enclosed by part
of the old Roman wall.  Nevertheless, they were still centers of
population and generated a certain amount of traffic. Some village
artisans moved to these centers, increasing their population and
importance. The long-distance traders often found these locations
convenient for breaking their journey, selling some of their goods,
dividing cargo, or even trading with merchants arriving from distant
parts. They often established residences and warehouses (called
"factories") in the villages adjacent to the main administrative centers
and took the lead in restoring and extending the old Roman walls to
complete the defenses of an essentially new manufacturing and commercial
center.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>The presence of a population of artisans and
merchants attracted a number of other specialists such as physicians,
apothecaries, teachers, parchment-makers, scribes, lawyers, cobblers,
furriers, butchers, bakers, cooks, prostitutes, barbers, tailors, and all
of the other tradesmen necessary to support an urban population. Some of
these centers developed some specialty of local manufacture. Centers along
pilgrimage roots usually had a large number of shoemakers, for instance,
since pilgrims walked for hundreds of miles along rocky roads and needed
new shoes at regular intervals. The towns of Belgium began to use the fine
wool of the sheep who pastured in the meadows and marshes along the sea
to weave high-grade cloth for export to other towns.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>&lt;i&gt;A note of explanation. Technically
speaking a "city" in the middle ages was the seat of a bishop -- a
cathedral with its dependent population.  A "town" was an urban center
without a bishop. So the difference between medieval cities and towns was
not one of size.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>Such industries increased local population
still further. The production of woolen cloth, for instance, required
carders (often women), fullers, dyers, spinners, weavers, printers
(sometimes), and merchants. there was also an increased need for common
laborers, and so many relatively unskilled peasants moved into the "new"
cities and towns. These urban centers needed supplies of both food and raw
materials for processing, and the supply of these commodities transformed
peasant society.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>Up to this time, there had been little
point, from the peasants' point of view, to producing a surplus except to
build up a reserve of food as insurance against crop failure, marauding
war parties, or any of the other dangers of the time. Neighboring
villages, producing the same crops, provided no market for surplus
commodities, and there was little enough to buy even if there had
been a cash market for surplus production. The need of the new and growing
cities and towns for food and raw materials changed that situation
completely, and many villagers now strove to increase their production and
to sell their crops in the urban centers. Some used their profits to
&lt;i&gt;commute&lt;/i&gt; their labor services. Instead of spending two
days a week in their lords' fields, providing two weeks of plowing, two
weeks of harvesting and numerous minor services, they paid an annual rent.
Now able to devote their full energies to producing and selling more than
had before been possible, such peasants were able to accumulate still more
money and to use this money to purchase the land rights of their less
fortunate neighbors. A class of landless peasants began to emerge that
swelled the ranks of the homeless and jobless poor. The poor moved from
place to place, seeking work, and offered a source of cheap labor for
plowing and harvesting that made it possible to make medieval agriculture
still more profitable for those who controlled the land. The village
community no longer had to support members whose sole contribution was to
provide the extra hands needed at harvest time.
