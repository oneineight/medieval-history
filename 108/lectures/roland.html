alt="[Map of the Frankish Empire and Spain in 778 AD]">
Charles the Great invaded Spain in the year 778. He had been invited in by
the governor of the strategic city of Zaragoza, who had promised to turn
the city over to him. He entered through a pass in the western Pyrenees
Mountains and marched through the lands of the Basques, a people who had
managed to maintain their freedom from Muslim domination and who were not
too pleased with the Franks entering their land without even asking
permission. Charles took care of their objections by seizing hostages and
allowing his men to loot and plunder the countryside as he headed east to
Zaragoza.  When he reached his objective, however, he found that the
Muslim governor had changed his mind, and that the gates of the city were
closed to him. After lingering a while to no purpose, he and his army
began to retrace their steps. The Basques were still angry with his
earlier treatment of them and, as his army went through the pass of
Roncevalles, attacked his rearguard. As Einhard noted in his<em> Life of
Charlemagne</em>, a few nobles were killed, including "Hrudoland, lord of
the Marches of Brittany."<p>
   
By the 900's, the shrine of Saint James of Compostela, located in the
northeastern corner of Spain, had become one of the most popular
pilgrimage sites of western Europe, and the main route from France to
Saint James lay through the pass of Roncevalles. Over time, Roland became
one of the heroes whose battlefield passing pilgrims were eager to see,
and, eventually, he became the protagonist of an epic poem. Although
historians have argued about when the written version that has survived
was composed, most now agree that it dates from sometime about 1200, and
was written somewhere in northern France. It is the most famous of a
number of similar tales, more or less based upon the events of the era of
the Carolingian monarchs and called <em>chansons de geste. </em>This means
"songs of deeds," and these songs were the preferred "literature" of the
nobility of the twelfth century. They were sung to their audience, much as
<em>Beowulf</em> was composed to be sung to an audience the members of
which were most illiterate.  <br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"> <p>The idea that
<em>Roland</em> and the other <em>chansons</em> were songs of
<strong>deeds</strong> lead many readers to miss the complexity of these
poems. If one views them simply as heroic tales in which one warrior chops
up a bunch of other warriors, they can seem rather primitive and quickly
become boring. The fact of the matter is that many of the
<em>chansons</em> are actually concerned with legal points, and more than
a few, like <em>The Song of Roland</em>, have an actual trial as their
central episode. You will see this again when you read <em>The Song of the
Cid</em>. They are much more like television programs such as <em>Law and
Order</em> or <em>Perry Mason</em> than <em>All-Star Wrestling</em> or
reruns of <em>Rocky</em>.<P>
  
This is not to say that the smash and stab parts of these poems are not
important. The audience probably loved them, but they realized that they
were incidental to the main action, much as the chase scenes in which all
sorts of cars smash into each other and blow up, scattering debris over
half the city, provide excitement but are not really essential to the
plot. Perhaps this is overstating the case. One tends to find out a good
deal about the characters of the actors in the drama during these
episodes. But it is best to concentrate your attention on the events
leading up to the battle-scenes rather than on the blood and glory
sections themselves. Another thing to remember is that medieval authors
were not "primitive"  or "unsophisticated." They <em>did</em> expect their
audience to pay close attention to what they were relating and to think
about what they were hearing or reading. They also expected them to be
familiar with the situations being pictured for them.<P>
  
It was the duty of every feudal vassal, for instance, to "pay court" to
his lord. That meant that the vassal was supposed to present himself on
those occasions when the lord called for an assembly to consider problems,
to hear complaints and settle disputes, to receive embassies, or anything
else requiring serious thought and discussion. Most of the audience of
<em>The Song of Roland</em> had experience in such meetings or was at
least learning how one should behave when their lord asked them for "aid
and counsel." So it should not come as a surprise to see that
<em>Roland</em> begins by providing the background necessary to understand
why Charlemagne had called a council of his nobles and what issue the
members of the council were suppose to discuss and offer advice about. You
might keep in mind that a lord was supposed to treat his vassals with
respect and honor. This meant that he couldn't ask for their advice and
simply reject it if it didn't suit him since that would not be showing his
counselors the respect they deserved. Medieval councils were not rubber
stamps [They didn't have rubber, in any event. It was one of the things
that they discovered in the New World.]<P>
  
So we have a meeting of the council to decide whether to attack Marsile of
Zaragoza, send another ambassador to negotiate with him (he had the last
two ambassadors chopped up into little pieces and sent them back to
Charlemagne in a basket), or simply pack up and go home. When the council
begins, Roland is the first to speak, arguing against going home even
though the army has been in Spain for seven years and has gotten quite
war-weary. Whoa! Roland is only about eighteen years old, a rather rash
young man. It's customary in council for the oldest and most experienced
members to speak first, and Roland has just behaved in a very offensive
manner. Of course, he is Charlemagne's nephew, the son of Charlemagne's
sister, but that's not good enough to excuse his action. Ganelon, as his
stepfather, admonishes him, as it is a father's (or a stepfather's) duty
to rein his son in when he is behaving badly. But Roland turns on Ganelon
and simply ridicules him. Ganelon tells Roland that he has never shown the
proper deference to his stepfather, a way of pointing out to the other
members of the council that he is not responsible for his stepson's lack
of manners. Roland answers by insulting him even more viciously.<P>
  
Something is obviously very wrong here, and whatever it is simply gets worse.
The council is finally swayed into  recommending another embassy. I don't know
about you, but I would not have relished the idea of being an ambassador to a 
man who had a record of chopping ambassadors up into little pieces. The members
of the council volunteer one by one, and  Charlemagne rejects them on the grounds
that he can't afford to lose them. Roland then volunteers his stepfather, and 
Charlemagne accepts the nomination. Ganelon flies into a rage and says that
Roland is trying to get him killed. He then  promises three times to take
vengeance on Roland and his buddies if he gets out of this alive. Bad show! This
sort of  declaration, repeated three times is known as a "defiance" and is,
according to the feudal law of the times, the start of  a legitimate feud. If the
person issuing the defiance succeeds in killing the person or persons whom he
defies, or if he  is killed by them, it will not be considered a crime but the
resolution of a private matter. Of course, one is not  allowed to issue a
defiance in a court or council, but Charlemagne does nothing to stop it [except
to say "tut, tut"]. So  Charlemagne gives Ganelon a sealed letter to deliver to
Marsile, outlining terms for a peace, and hands him the wand that  will make
Ganelon his   herald and official representative. But the wand falls before
Ganelon can get a grip on it, and he has to pick it up from  the ground rather
than receiving it from Charlemagne's hand.<P>
  
This episode sets in motion everything that follows, and it poses a lot of
questions that you need to keep in mind if you're ever going to figure out
what's actually going on. Why did Roland jump into the discussion out of
turn and why didn't Charlemagne call him to order after he simply laughed
at his stepfather for trying to correct him? Why is Roland so intent on
keeping the war going? How old is he, really -- remember that the army has
been in Spain for seven years.  Why does Charlemagne reject everyone until
he's given the choice of Ganelon? Why does Ganelon suddenly claim that
Roland is trying to kill him? Why doesn't Charlemagne intervene and stop
Ganelon's defiance? If the council has been called to decide what to do,
how come Charlemagne has a letter to Marsile already written and sealed?
When the ceremony of the passing of the baton breaks down, why doesn't
Charlemagne simply start over again? Did Ganelon simply fumble the pass,
or did Charlemagne drop the wand? If Charlemagne did drop the wand, did he
do in by accident or on purpose? Why are the counsellors so upset about
someone dropping a stick, anyway?<P>
  
Like the writer of a mystery story, the author of <em>The Song of
Roland</em> has given you a lot of clues that he expects you to follow up
as you learn the rest of the story. And like the writer of a mystery
story, the author has given you clues that seem to point in all sorts of
directions. And, if you've read many good mysteries, you are probably
aware that the most important clue might very well be something that the
author did <em>not</em> say. That's a good thing to keep in the back of
your mind as you begin to read <em>The Song of Roland</em>. Is there
something important that the author seems to have left out?<P>
