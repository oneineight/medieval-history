1. The Muslims, mainly Berbers from nearby Morocco, invaded Spain in the year
   711 and, within five years, had gained control of almost the entire
   peninsula. Not all of the conquest was a matter of force; several local
   leaders accepted Islam along with their people and even aided in the
   conquest. The Muslims did not particularly encourage such conversions,
   since they hoped to become rich in the new land, and fellow Muslims   even
   new converts paid no taxes and were free men. Consequently, there was a
   large Christian population in Muslim lands (called <i>Mozarabs</i>) who
   adopted much Muslim culture and customs but clung to their Christian
   faith. There were some regions that the Muslims were unable to subdue,
   such as the Basques in the rugged Pyrenean lands of the North.<p>

   The most important Christian center, however, was in the Cantabrian
   Mountains, where, according to legend, a number of Visigothic warriors and
   clerics had taken refuge. Again according to legend, a group of these
   warriors met in a cave at Covadonga to decide what to do. They agreed to
   choose a king to lead them to the reconquest of their lands and to follow
   him as long as he respected them and observed their customs. Their choice
   was a fellow warrior named Pelayo (the same as Pelagius), and Pelayo and
   his successors established the Kingdom of Asturias.<p>

   The Asturians operated much as bandits, raiding from their mountain
   fastnesses, but they slowly extended the area of their control until they
   finally captured the city of Le&oacute;n. Le&oacute;n had been the chief
   military center in the North under the Romans (its name was "city of the
   legion") and it was extremely well-fortified. The Asturian monarchs
   transferred their capital to Le&oacute;n, and their realm became known as
   the Kingdom of Le&oacute;n.<p>

   In the 800's, they gained control of Galicia, the land to their west, and
   the kings claimed to have discovered there the tomb of Saint James the
   disciple and apostle. Saint James, as Santiago, became the patron saint of
   the Spanish Christians, and a great pilgrimage route to his tomb at
   Santiago de Compostela began to attract pilgrims from all over western
   Europe. At about the same time, the counts that Charlemagne had
   established along his Spanish frontier, led by the famous Raymond of
   Toulouse, established counties south of the mountains. The most important
   of these was in the northeast of the peninsula, Catalu&ntilde;a, with its
   capital of Barcelona. Finally, the kings of Le&oacute;n established a
   heavily fortified district to the southeast, building castles and
   establishing garrisons to defend their kingdom from Muslim attacks from
   that direction.<p>

   This fortified district became known as <i>Castilla</i>, "The Land of
   Castles." The lands of Castile were not very fertile and there was almost
   continual skirmishing along the frontier, so, while the nobility of
   Le&oacute;n grew rich and secure, Castile remained a land of numerous
   minor nobles with small holdings accustomed to hard fighting and constant
   danger. The Le&oacute;nese nobles held their Castilian brothers-in-arms in
   some contempt, referring to them as "pig farmers," and so there was
   finally a conflict between them. The legend is that the count of Castile,
   Fern&aacute;n Gonzalez (920-970), was out hunting with Sancho, the King of
   Le&oacute;n (955-965), and Sancho began admiring Fern&aacute;n's horse.
   Fernando offered to give the animal to his lord, but for various reasons
   Sancho insisted on buying it. He didn't have any money with him, but
   promised to pay the full price within a year, going on that the price
   should double every year that he failed to pay. He didn't. Later that
   year, he accused Fern&aacute;n of plotting a rebellion against him and
   imprisoned him. The Castilians rebelled, Fern&aacute;n escaped and a long
   civil war ensued. Fern&aacute;n was finally captured, and Sancho was about
   to condemn him to death when Fern&aacute;n demanded that Sancho pay him
   for the horse he had bought several years earlier. Since the price had
   been doubling each year, Sancho saw that he would never have enough money
   to pay the debt and could not fail to keep his promise without losing his
   honor in front of all of his nobles. He ended up by giving Fern&aacute;n
   the county of Castile as an independent holding and setting him free.<p>

   In 1004, Almanzor, the military dictator of Muslim Spain died, and civil
   war soon broke out between many of the regions that had comprised that
   state. The Muslims soon began calling in Christian mercenaries, and the
   Christians -- as soon as they realized how weak and divided the Muslims
   were -- began to demand annual payments to protect the little states that
   asked for their protection and to threaten to attack others unless they
   also paid such protection money. Muslim gold began to flow into the
   Christian states, and their power grew. At about the same time that
   Almanzor died, a king known as Sancho the Great (1000-1036) (took over the
   kingdom of Navarra (the territory of the Basques) and managed to establish
   his control over most of the Christian states of Spain, including Castile.
   When he died in 1036, he divided up his territories like the Merovingian
   and Carolingian monarchs had done.<p>

   His eldest son, Garc&iacute;a, succeeded him as king of Navarra (1036-
   1054); Ramiro, an illegitimate son, was given the county of Aragon (which
   he soon turned into an independent kingdom) (1036-1064), and another son,
   Fernando was given the independent county of Castile (1036-1037) and was
   married to the sister of Beremudo (1028-1037) the young king of
   Le&oacute;n. The king of Le&oacute;n attacked Garc&iacute;a of Navarra to
   get back some Le&oacute;nese lands that had been taken over by the
   Navarrese. He was defeated and killed, and Fernando of Castile became king
   of Le&oacute;n (1037-1065) by right of his wife, the heiress to the realm.
   Le&oacute;n and Castile were again united, but under a man who valued the
   fighting men of Castile more than the wealthy nobles of Le&oacute;n, who
   were always conspiring to reduce his power. Nevertheless, both states
   prospered under his firm and relatively long rule. When he died in 1065,
   however, he also divided his realms.<p>

   Sancho (1065-1072), his eldest son, received the kingdom of Castile;
   Alfonso (1065-1109), his second son, became king of Le&oacute;n, and his
   youngest son, Garc&iacute;a (1065-1072), was given the kingdom of Galicia.
   Sancho of Castile, aided by his young standard-bearer, Rodrigo D&iacute;az
   of the Castilian village of Bivar, immediately began to reunite the
   realms. He deposed Garc&iacute;a in 1071 and took over Galicia; in 1072,
   he drove Alfonso out of Le&oacute;n and had himself crowned king. Alfonso
   attempted to return from his refuge in Muslim Toledo but was defeated and
   again took refuge, this time with his sister, Urraca, in her city of
   Zamora. While laying siege to Zamora, Sancho was tricked into a conference
   near the city's walls, and was killed by one of Urraca's soldiers. Alfonso
   immediately returned to claim his kingdom of Le&oacute;n. Since Sancho had
   died without heirs, he also claimed Castile.<p>

   When he arrived at Burgos, the capital of Castile to assume the crown, he
   found that the Castilians suspected him (probably correctly) of having
   planned the murder of their king, Sancho. Rodrigo D&iacute;az acted as
   their representative and, in a famous scene, demanded that Alfonso stand
   on the steps of the church of Santa Gadea and, in front of the nobles of
   Castile, swear three times on the Bible that he was innocent of having
   conspired in the death of King Sancho. Alfonso swore, but was angry with
   Rodrigo for having demanded this of him and waited for an opportunity to
   take revenge on him.<p>

   It was some years before he felt that he could afford to dispense with the
   services of his most able warrior and the man most respected by the
   Castilian nobles. In 1080, he sent Rodrigo to collect the tribute owed by
   the Muslim city-state of Seville. When he arrived, he found that Count
   Garc&iacute;a Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez of Najera, one of Alfonso's favorites,
   had been sent on a similar mission to the city of Granada and was
   preparing to attack Seville with a large army. Rodrigo had only a few men,
   but attacked Count Garc&iacute;a and defeated him in a spectacular
   victory. According to legend, Rodrigo went up to Garc&iacute;a during the
   battle, grabbed his beard and twisted his nose. These were absolutely
   deadly insults at the time, and Garc&iacute;a never forgave him. Rodrigo
   seized the goods of the attackers and then allowed them to go free.<p>

   When Rodrigo returned to Burgos, he found that Garc&iacute;a
   Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez was already there and had told Alfonso that Rodrigo
   had stayed down at Seville for longer than was necessary so that he could
   attack the Granadans and take booty from them. Alfonso had not waited to
   have a trial. Rodrigo was informed that he had broken his oath of fealty
   and homage by being faithless and seeking his own advantage at the expense
   of his lord's. Alfonso had dissolved the contract between them and seized
   all of the property that Rodrigo held of him. As king, Alfonso had
   declared that Rodrigo had defrauded the realm, seized all of the good that
   he had won in battle against Count Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez and confiscated
   all of his private holdings and possessions. As punishment for his
   "crimes," Alfonso had declared that he must leave the realm within three
   days, taking nothing with him and receiving aid or assistance from no
   one.<p>

   It is at this point that <i>The Song of the Cid</i>, or as much of it as
   has survived, begins.<p>

2. The poem obscures what happened during the next few years. Rodrigo left,
   was joined by several fighting men who preferred to remain loyal to him
   rather than obey King Alfonso, and sought employment as a mercenary. He
   was turned down by the Counts of Barcelona, and so took service under the
   Muslim king of Zaragoza in 1082 and defended the Muslim kingdom against
   Christian attacks. Alfonso broke with the system by which the Muslims paid
   him what amounted to tribute, and, in 1085, captured Toledo, the old
   Visigothic capital. All of Europe was electrified by the news of this
   victory and by tales of the fabulous wealth that had been taken along with
   the city. The most famous single piece of loot was the table of Solomon,
   which was carved from a single great emerald. This was pure fantasy, of
   course, but one finds it recorded as fact in chronicles and annals written
   as far away as Denmark and Poland.<p>

   The rulers of the other Muslim states of Spain realized that they could no
   longer buy protection from the Christians, and called for help from North
   Africa. A zealous movement had arisen among the Muslims of West Africa.
   Converts to this sect, known as <i>al-Murabitun</i>, or Almoravids in
   English, retired to live in a fortified army camp (<i>murabit</i>),
   practice austerity, and fight to spread Islam. Their leader, Yusuf ibn
   Tashufin, crossed over into Spain where he joined his forces with those of
   the Muslim states. Alfonso had gotten used to the idea that Muslims could
   not fight -- it had been more than eighty years since the death of
   Almanzor and the disintegration of the Caliphate of Cordoba -- and went
   out to attack the Muslims. He met them at Zalaka, north of Badajoz, and
   they came very close to entirely wiping out the Christian army (1086).<p>

   Alfonso went into a panic, calling for aid from the French and threatening
   to guide the Muslims through the Pyrenees to attack France if he didn't
   get such help. He also told Rodrigo D&iacute;az that it had all been a
   mistake, took him back as a vassal, and gave him permission to take and
   hold whatever Muslim territory he could. All of this was somewhat
   premature, since Yusuf ibn Tashufin , for some reason or another, took his
   army back to Africa. The Spanish Muslims were not able to hold the
   advantage that Yusuf had gained them, and Rodrigo managed first to
   establish control of, and finally to conquer the rich and beautiful Muslim
   city-kingdom of Valencia, with its fertile delta and its Mediterranean
   port (1094). The Almoravids returned to Spain to try to liberate Valencia,
   but were badly defeated by Rodrigo, the first time they had ever been
   beaten in battle.<p>

   Rodrigo held Valencia until his death in 1099. Legend has it that the
   Christians tied his dead body on his horse and let it out the main gate of
   the city. When the Muslims who were besieging the city saw him riding at
   them, they panicked and ran. Whatever the case, Rodrigo's wife, Jimena,
   held the city for three more years until Alfonso, convinced that the
   position could not be held forever, ordered her to withdraw. She left
   Valencia in 1102, burning the city behind her, and carried her husband's
   body back to Castile, to be re-buried at the monastery of San Pedro de
   Carde&ntilde;a. Tales of Rodrigo's exploits began to circulate throughout
   Europe. Some time about 1150, his story was written down in an epic called
   the <I>Cantar de mio Cid</I>, one of the few Christian heroes of the
   Spanish Reconquest to be known familiarly by a Muslim title (<i>Cid</i> =
   <i>sidi</i> or "lord").<p>

   As time passed, more and more exploits were added to the story of the Cid,
   and they grew more and more fantastic until Rodrigo had become a
   fictitious character, a subject for ballads, songs, and children's tales.
   Early in this century, however, a young Spanish scholar, Ram&oacute;n
   Men&eacute;ndez Pidal, decided to devote himself to the study of the
   character of the Cid. He spent his entire life on the task   and he lived
   to be ninety-nine years old. During the course of a lifetime of study, he
   rescued the figure of Rodrigo D&iacute;az de Bivar from the field of
   fiction and restored him as an historical figure. More than that, he
   placed him firmly in his times by unraveling the complex history of
   eleventh-century Spain. If you are interested in learning more about this,
   Men&eacute;ndez' major book is <I>The Cid and His Spain</i><p>

3  Like many feudal epics, the Song of the Cid leads up to the climax of a
   trial, and, like many, the basis of its action is the relation between a
   vassal and his lord. Unlike most, however, it has a clear theme that is
   maintained, in one form or another throughout the poem: "What a good
   vassal, if he only had a good lord!" Almost every incident in the poem
   demonstrates either Rodrigo's nobility or Alfonso's lack of character, and
   many demonstrate both at the same time. One motif running through the
   story is Rodrigo's constant honoring of Alfonso in an attempt to get the
   king to take him back as his vassal, but a careful reader will also see
   that Rodrigo continually places Alfonso in positions that test the king's
   honor and that Alfonso continually fails those tests.<p>    

   Consequently, one must consider every event carefully. There is one
   instance, for example, when the Cid sends his own vassal, Alvar
   Ha&ntilde;ez, to Alfonso with a gift of a number of fine horses. It would
   appear as if Rodrigo is simply honoring Alfonso, but he is in fact
   tempting him. Alfonso should refuse the horses, since a lord accepts such
   gifts only from a vassal, or he should take the horses and take Rodrigo
   back into his favor. He does neither, being too pig-headed to recognize
   the worth of the Cid and too greedy to turn down the horses. Instead, he
   points out that Alvar Ha&ntilde;ez is his vassal and in his favor  
   although he has done nothing for Alvar   and accepts the horses as a gift
   from Alvar, offering nothing in return. Which means of course, that Alvar
   ends up owing the Cid, something that Alfonso seems not to bother himself
   about in the slightest. The poem is full of such instances, and the end of
   the poem displays the king as completely dead to honor.<p>

   The poem also demonstrates how a good lord behaves towards his vassals
   through the example of the Cid and his followers. Alvar Ha&ntilde;ez is
   portrayed as the happiest of all vassals, honored and enriched by his
   lord. He is so certain that the Cid will do the right thing that all he
   needs to think about is how to serve Rodrigo as well as he is able. Both
   Alvar and Rodrigo bring glory and riches to the other, and live in perfect
   harmony, trust, and comradeship. One must remember that romantic love in
   western literature did not appear until the early eleventh century, and
   the <I>chansons de geste</I> consider the most important human
   relationship to be that between vassal and lord. If you try to imagine the
   audience feeling the desperation of the Cid and the joy of Alvar
   Ha&ntilde;ez with the same passion with which we follow a truly great love
   story, you will begin to recognize the greatness of <I>The Song of the
   Cid</I><p>
